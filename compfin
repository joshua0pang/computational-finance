; Computational Finance

; predicates: resource, need-resource, local
; operators: request, allocate
; methods: allocate-to-person, request-path
; the procedural rhetoric is a twist on my computaitonal finance thesis.
; in my thesis, i talk about using computer algorithms to "pay people to vote"
; here, i remove the idea of money altogether â€” cut out the middle man
; on a ship, a sailor doesn't spend money to get coffee.
; he just goes and gets it, and the accounting book is updated.
; things are rationed rationally.
; so, a little proof of concept about a society where algorithms allocate resources rationally.
; fuller says, "cosmic accounting" on "spaceship earth"
; eventually, the idea is sort of 'reverse Sims'
; that is, an algorithm meets our needs like we meet the ; Sims' needs.
