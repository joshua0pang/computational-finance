  ; The initial facts of the world. This world has two locactions local together. "Me" (the agent
  ; in this world) starts in one resource and the person you're supposed to allocate "hello" to is in the
  ; other. Note that HTN domains don't have to be about explicit agents in worlds. For example, the
  ; blocks world and freecell domains don't have a represented agent in a world - instead there is a
  ; world containing a "problem" which the system is trying to solve.
