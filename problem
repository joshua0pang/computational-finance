; Here I must define the world for the computational finance domain file to operate over. The computational domain is the producer in the classic producer consumer problem. For a proof of concept, this is fine.
; It would be better if all I had to do was give my name and address and my needed object on a standard form.
; Instead, I also need to describe all the industrial components, which is not consumer friendly. These would be under the hood normally.

(defproblem problem compfin   
   ((recipe gold-ring gold)
    (factory smelter)
    (exists smelter sf) ; in this example the smelter is the factory
    (exists Josh sc)
    (exists gold sf))

; here I make a call to the main method using the standard form. This would be closer to the form that a consumer would fill out.
   ((allocate gold-ring Josh sc))
